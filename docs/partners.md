# Agents of D3

**_Agents_** are medium and large size companies that are **_accredited by D3_** and sign an **_Agent agreement_** with **_D3 Corp_**. They interact with [**_Clients_**](https://github.com/alexeymaklakov/D3-wiki/blob/master/docs/clients.md "Clients of D3") and provide the [**_Clients_**](https://github.com/alexeymaklakov/D3-wiki/blob/master/docs/clients.md "Clients of D3") with access to D3. [**_Clients_**](https://github.com/alexeymaklakov/D3-wiki/blob/master/docs/clients.md "Clients of D3") have **_contract_** relations with **_Agents_** only (not with D3).

**_Agents_** are running a [**_full D3ledger node_**](https://github.com/alexeymaklakov/D3-wiki/blob/master/docs/nodes.md "Nodes in D3 network"), as well as the **_nodes of associated blockchains_**, reading the **_D3ledger_** and sending information to [**_Validators_**](https://github.com/alexeymaklakov/D3-wiki/blob/master/docs/validators.md "Validators of D3") to be written to the ledger. They can initiate an **_internal transaction_**, as well as a **_deposit_** / **_withdrawal_** **_transaction_** via a **_decentralized link_**.

**_Agents_** can also provide additional services to [**_Clients_**](https://github.com/alexeymaklakov/D3-wiki/blob/master/docs/clients.md "Clients of D3"), such as making deals with OTC-brokers, connected to **_D3ledger_**, on behalf of its Clients.

[**_Client_**](https://github.com/alexeymaklakov/D3-wiki/blob/master/docs/clients.md "Clients of D3") also may be an **_Agent_** as well, and in that case they run all their **_operations_** through their own **_node_**.
