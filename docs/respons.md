# Responsibility of participants

## Validator

[**_Validators_**](https://github.com/alexeymaklakov/D3-wiki/blob/master/docs/validators.md "Validators of D3") are responsible to compensate Clients’ losses of assets in [**_D3ledger_**](https://github.com/alexeymaklakov/D3-wiki/blob/master/docs/dlt.md "D3 Ledger") or assets “locked” in original blockchains (Bitcoin and Ethereum) because of [**_D3ledger_**](https://github.com/alexeymaklakov/D3-wiki/blob/master/docs/dlt.md "D3 Ledger").

[**_Validators_**](https://github.com/alexeymaklakov/D3-wiki/blob/master/docs/validators.md "Validators of D3") are not responsible for [**_Client_**](https://github.com/alexeymaklakov/D3-wiki/blob/master/docs/clients.md "Clients of D3") assets losses in the following cases:
  
  1) Client’s private key used (expected to be securely stored by the Client). 
  All the transactions signed by the Client’s private key are considered confirmed by the [**_Client_**](https://github.com/alexeymaklakov/D3-wiki/blob/master/docs/clients.md "Clients of D3"). 
  
  2) External blockchains (Bitcoin or Ethereum) malfunction or hacks. 
  **_D3_** may not be responsible for Bitcoin or Ethereum blockchain security.
  
  3) Illegal actions by [**_Agents_**](https://github.com/alexeymaklakov/D3-wiki/blob/master/docs/agents.md "Agents of D3")
  [**_Validators_**](https://github.com/alexeymaklakov/D3-wiki/blob/master/docs/validators.md "Validators of D3") do not cover risks of fraudulent behavior by [**_Agents_**](https://github.com/alexeymaklakov/D3-wiki/blob/master/docs/agents.md "Agents of D3"). In those cases [**_Clients_**](https://github.com/alexeymaklakov/D3-wiki/blob/master/docs/clients.md "Clients of D3") should sue [**_Agents_**](https://github.com/alexeymaklakov/D3-wiki/blob/master/docs/agents.md "Agents of D3") in court.
  
  4) Fraudulent actions by the [**_Clients_**](https://github.com/alexeymaklakov/D3-wiki/blob/master/docs/clients.md "Clients of D3") in D3

If several [**_Validators_**](https://github.com/alexeymaklakov/D3-wiki/blob/master/docs/validators.md "Validators of D3") are hacked or perform an incorrect validation and that causes Clients’ losses then only the [**_Validators_**](https://github.com/alexeymaklakov/D3-wiki/blob/master/docs/validators.md "Validators of D3") involved have to compensate the losses. For example, 2/3 of the [**_Validators_**](https://github.com/alexeymaklakov/D3-wiki/blob/master/docs/validators.md "Validators of D3") have been hacked and their [**_nodes_**](https://github.com/alexeymaklakov/D3-wiki/blob/master/docs/nodes.md "D3 nodes") manipulated in order to accept invalid **_transaction_**, other [**_Validators_**](https://github.com/alexeymaklakov/D3-wiki/blob/master/docs/validators.md "Validators of D3") and their [**_nodes_**](https://github.com/alexeymaklakov/D3-wiki/blob/master/docs/nodes.md "D3 nodes") resisted the attack. Only the [**_Validators_**](https://github.com/alexeymaklakov/D3-wiki/blob/master/docs/validators.md "Validators of D3") who could not resist the attack should compensate Clients’ losses caused by the attack.
