# Distributed ledger

The technology employed in the D3ledger Platform ensures the
seamless operation of **_crypto assets_** on and between different
**_distributed ledgers_**.

D3ledger Mainchain is a **_blockchain ledger_** based on [**_Hyperledger
Iroha_**](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/iroha "Hyperledger Iroha") system incorporating [**_YAC2_**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00554 "Zhang, J., Wang, Y., & Liu, D. (2017).
Yac: Yet another distributed consensus algorithm"), a variation of the chain-based
**_Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT)_** **_consensus protocol_**.

D3ledger is maintained by the network of participants, or **_notaries_** â€” which implies there is no central entity in charge of transaction history management.
D3ledger blockchain consistency is maintained by geographically distributed **_nodes_**, which are operated by the **_Validators_** network. 
**_Validators_** operate in different jurisdictions. In case one or even several **_Validators_** and/or nodes fail D3ledger remains up and running.
The system uses the network of **_nodes_** that interact with each other in order to validate transactions within the ecosystem and perform other functions.
