# Distributed ledger

The technology employed in the D3ledger Platform ensures the
seamless operation of **_crypto assets_** on and between different
**_distributed ledgers_**.

D3ledger Mainchain is a **_blockchain ledger_** based on [**_Hyperledger
Iroha_**](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/iroha "Hyperledger Iroha") system incorporating [**_YAC2_**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00554 "Zhang, J., Wang, Y., & Liu, D. (2017).
Yac: Yet another distributed consensus algorithm"), a variation of the chain-based
**_Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT)_** **_consensus protocol_**.
