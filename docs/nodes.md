# Nodes in D3 network

The system uses
the network of **nodes** that interact with each other in order to **_validate_**
**_transactions_** within the ecosystem and perform other functions.

A D3ledger **node** can operate in three modes: 

1. it can **_validate_** **_transactions_** according to the network **_rules_**

2. it can charge **_fees_** for **_transactions_**

3. it can ensure other **nodes** **_operate honestly_**, and impose **_penalties_** on them should they fail to act so

In any case, a **node** requires a certain amount of **_assets_** in order to operate. This amount doubles every time four new **nodes** join the
network.
