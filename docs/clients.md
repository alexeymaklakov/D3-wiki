# Clients

Clients of D3 can be both individuals or companies, such as investors, banks, payment processors, or stock exchanges. 

They generate and keep their **_private keys_** that have **_certificates_** issued by a **_certification center_**, which is a special entity recognized by other D3ledger customers involved in the **_transaction_** requiring said keys. 

In most cases, clients have to run operations on D3ledger by accessing the [**_nodes_**](https://github.com/alexeymaklakov/D3-wiki/blob/master/docs/nodes.md "Nodes in D3 network") run by D3ledger [**_partners_**](https://github.com/alexeymaklakov/D3-wiki/blob/master/docs/partners.md "Partners of D3").

A D3ledger client can change a D3ledger [**_partner_**](https://github.com/alexeymaklakov/D3-wiki/blob/master/docs/partners.md "Partner of D3") that handles their **_transactions_** at any time, or use the services from several [**_partners_**](https://github.com/alexeymaklakov/D3-wiki/blob/master/docs/partners.md "Partners of D3") at once.
