# Clients

Clients of D3 can be both individuals or companies, such as investors, banks, payment processors, or stock exchanges. 

They generate and keep their **_private keys_** that have **_certificates_** issued by a **_certification center_**, which is a special entity recognized by other D3ledger customers involved in the **_transaction_** requiring said keys. 

In most cases, clients have to run operations on D3ledger by accessing the **_nodes_** run by D3ledger **_partners_**.

A D3ledger client can change a D3ledger **_partner_** that handles their **_transactions_** at any time, or use the services from several **_partners_** at once.
