# Pseudonym management service

**Pseudonym management service** is a special system for managing
the pseudonyms of D3ledger participants required to fit within the
existing **_account_** structure. The service can also implement **_whitelisting_**
options to filter out **_assets_** banned in a particular jurisdiction, and
thus transparently block unwanted **_transactions_**.
