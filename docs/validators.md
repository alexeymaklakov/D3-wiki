# Validators of D3

**_Validators_** is a key group that is responsible for **_D3 blockchain_** consistency. They run [**_Validation Nodes_**](https://github.com/alexeymaklakov/D3-wiki/blob/master/docs/nodes.md "Nodes in D3 network") that interact with each other in order to **_validate_** **_transactions_** within the ecosystem and maintain blockchain. 

This group **_approves_** and **_records_** **_transactions_** into blocks and blocks into blockchain.

**_D3ledger_** intends to have the number of **_Validators_** around ten. They are supposed to be geographically distributed, well-known and reputable companies. This would allow having the D3 Ledger resilient keeping high blockchain performance.

**_Validators_** are incentivized to ensure that all the transactions are recorded in blockchain only after necessary **_validation checks_**. 

**_Validators_** are elected by [**_Investors_**](https://github.com/alexeymaklakov/D3-wiki/blob/master/docs/investors.md "Investors in D3 network") using **_Cumulative voting_**.

When elected a **_Validator_** signs a **_Validator contract_**, containing a **_Service Level Agreement (SLA)_**, with [**_D3 Corp_**](https://github.com/alexeymaklakov/D3-wiki/blob/master/docs/d3corp.md "D3 Corp"). Based on that agreement **_Validators_** are **_rewarded by_** [**_D3 Corp_**](https://github.com/alexeymaklakov/D3-wiki/blob/master/docs/d3corp.md "D3 Corp") along with accepting **_claims_** in case of Clients’ **_losses_**.
**_Validators_** can request IT support from the [**_Operator_**](https://github.com/alexeymaklakov/D3-wiki/blob/master/docs/operator.md "Operator"). The [**_Operator_**](https://github.com/alexeymaklakov/D3-wiki/blob/master/docs/operator.md "Operator") reacts to **_Validators_** requests based on its **_SLA_**.

## Validator functions
 
1.	Validate transactions
Check and confirm that transactions meet certain **_D3 network criteria_**. 

2.	Agree on blocks
Consensus protocol requires that certain number of **_validation nodes_** agree on the same set of transactions to be included into block. 

3.	Maintain the correct state of the blockchain
Make sure that the agreed blocks (and only they) are recorded to blockchain.

4.	Approve **_deposit_**/**_withdrawal_** operations with Bitcoin, Ethereum and ERC20 Tokens
**_Validators_** control crypto assets that are **_locked_** on the original blockchains and approve “cross-chain” operations

All the functions are performed automatically by **_D3 blockchain_** validation [**_nodes_**](https://github.com/alexeymaklakov/D3-wiki/blob/master/docs/nodes.md "Nodes in D3 network").
