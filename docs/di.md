# Distributed identity

**Distributed Identity** is an example of [**_self-sovereign identity_**](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1712/1712.01767.pdf "Der, U., Jähnichen, S., & Sürmeli, J. (2017,
December 5). Self-sovereign Identity −
Opportunities and Challenges for the
Digital Revolution") with
multi-layer support for structured legal entities and their employees.

According to the [**_Decentralized Identity Trilemma_**](http://maciek.blog/decentralized-identity-trilemma/ "Laskus, M. (2018, August 13).
Decentralized Identity Trilemma") none of the
existing solutions can be privacy-preserving, Sybil-resistant and selfsovereign
at the same time. While the trilemma is true, it concerns
only individuals, not legal entities, and therefore is not applicable to
D3ledger. For that reason, the **distributed identity** mechanism can
preserve privacy, ensure self-sovereignty, and be Sybil-resistant at
once.
