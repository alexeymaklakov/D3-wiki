## Rewarding of validator

**_D3 Corp_** rewards **_Validators_** for following the **_SLA_**. **_Validators_** get the right to associate themselves to **_D3 Ledger project_**.

If the **_Validator_** is the **_Investor_** at the same time, it does not get extra reward for validating. If a **_Validator_** is not an **_Investor_** then it gets paid for providing Validation service and taking the risks of possible Clientsâ€™ losses. 

The amount of money paid to a Validator is discussed individually.
