# Summary

D3ledger (Decentralized Digital Depository) is a decentralized financial infrastructure that enables market participants to safely work with all kinds of **_crypto_** and **_traditional financial assets_** while benefiting from well-founded legal basis, explicit regulatory compliance, and clear governance arrangements. 

D3ledger uses **_distributed ledger technology_** to provide **_safekeeping_**, **_settlement_**, and **_asset servicing_** functions accessible without any **_intermediaries_**. Such architecture guarantees the high level of robustness and reliability. 

D3Ledger enables access to all kind of **_crypto assets_**, including **_crypto currencies_**, **_utility tokens_**, **_security tokens_**, **_tokenized fiat_**, and **_tokenized securities_**. Bank connections and tokenization are provided by a network of [**_partners_**](https://github.com/alexeymaklakov/D3-wiki/blob/master/docs/partners.md "Partners of D3"), including **_depositories_**, in established financial centers. 

The D3ledger infrastructure can be used for work with **_crypto_** and **_traditional financial assets_** by professional market players, banks, exchanges, wealth management funds and other financial institutions, as well as institutional investors, family offices, and high net worth individuals.

## Features and Functionality

The D3ledger ecosystem offers several functional advantages to its
[**_clients_**](https://github.com/alexeymaklakov/D3-wiki/blob/master/docs/clients.md "Clients of D3") that cover the full scope of activities undertaken with
**_crypto assets_**.

### Universal account

All trading operations with **_crypto_** and
**_traditional financial assets_** can be conducted within a single
account connected to numerous **_depositories_** and other kinds of
financial institutions. It is an environment where the [**_client_**](https://github.com/alexeymaklakov/D3-wiki/blob/master/docs/clients.md "Client of D3") can
access numerous **_crypto assets_**, **_tokenize_** their own assets, **_trade_**,
**_exchange_**, and operate them.

### Full control

All **_assets_** of the [**_client_**](https://github.com/alexeymaklakov/D3-wiki/blob/master/docs/clients.md "Client of D3") are stored in one place, and
the [**_client_**](https://github.com/alexeymaklakov/D3-wiki/blob/master/docs/clients.md "Client of D3") is the only one controlling them. D3ledger acts as a
**_decentralized depository_** for organized markets, and the [**_client_**](https://github.com/alexeymaklakov/D3-wiki/blob/master/docs/clients.md "Client of D3") can
operate their **_assets_** without **_withdrawing_** them from the system.

### Multi-leg settlement

The system ensures risk-free **_settlements_**
and **_delivery versus payment (DVP)_** settlements. However, unlike
traditional **_DVP_**, D3ledger offers a decentralized environment
which completely eliminates minimal risks associated with the **_DVP_**
model. Additionally, parties can **_exchange_** several **_assets_** in one go,
and the number of possible participants is not limited to two. This
feature also works as an execution mechanism for settlements with
third-party **_exchanges_**.

### Asset servicing

D3ledger offers an environment for holders of
various **_assets_** where they can realize their **_rights_** via conducting
corporate actions, such as voting, repurchasing or splitting stocks,
dividend payouts, different kinds of reorganization and cancellation
of shares, and distributions, among others. [**_Clients_**](https://github.com/alexeymaklakov/D3-wiki/blob/master/docs/clients.md "Clients of D3") can work with
different **_assets_** and **_rights_** in tokenized form from their **_universal
account_**.

### Safekeeping

The employment of **_blockchain_** tech ensures the
availability of numerous additional layers of security for **_asset_**
**_safekeeping_**, such as Threshold Signature, a **_multisignature_** system
that requires several lower-level **_multisignatures_** for the **_transaction_**
to become effective. This access mechanism ensures that any
movement of funds is duly authorized, and excludes possible
errors or theft. The system operates **_security tokens_** that implement
corporate actions.
