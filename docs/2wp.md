# Two-way peg mechanism in D3ledger

**Two-way peg** mechanism incorporated in D3ledger acts as the means
of [**_interacting with other blockchains_**](https://blockstream.com/sidechains.pdf "Back, A., Corallo, M., Dashjr, L.,
Friedenbach, M., Maxwell, G., Miller, A.,
Wuille, P. (2015, October 22). Enabling

Sidechains") and **_distributed ledger systems_**.
This mechanism allows one to “move” **_assets_** to other **_blockchains_** and
back by locking the **_assets_** on the original **_blockchain_** in an **_escrow_**
and releasing the equivalent **_assets_** on the target **_blockchain_**.
